The photo was taken by the Chilean actress-model Susana Hidalgo on the same day as one of the largest demonstrations since the return of democracy in Chile, which mobilized 1.2 million people through Santiago’s downtown area. The Mapuches, first nation people hailing mostly from Chile and Argentina, are known for their struggles in defense of their rights, especially on land reform, and their flag has often been used as a symbol of protests against social inequality.",

					"descripcion":"Lake Conjola, New South Wales, Australia, December 31, 2019: a kangaroo tries to escape a wildfire near a burning house in a World Press prize-winning photo. The annual fire season in Australia began early and was exceptionally severe following months of record-breaking drought and fanned by strong winds. Far stronger wildfires than usual, mostly battled by volunteer firefighters, raged through Australia, laid waste to bushland and rainforest and destroyed homes. By the end of January 2020, more than 30 people had been killed, 3,000 homes lost and around 12.6 million hectares of land burned. Wildlife was harshly hit. Local scientists estimated that up to one billion animals perished, and more than 50% of the Gondwana rainforest traversing New South Wales and Queensland was burned. In December, while the intensity and speed at which many bushfires were spreading increased, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison went on holiday to Hawaii and was prompted to return only after the death of two volunteer firefighters. He continued to champion a pro-fossil fuel policy and held back from linking the fires to the climate crisis.",

Reuters photographer Adrees Latif stated the following about his photo: “In the river, dozens of migrant men had locked arms to make a snake-like human cordon from the Guatemalan side to Mexico, so no-one would get swept by its powerful pull. A family that had made it to the middle of the river was handing their children to other men to help them reach the shore. Moments later, the last set of migrants crossed, and the men who had locked hands in the cordon all swam towards Mexico and started celebrating that everyone in the caravan had made it safely. This photograph begs the question: why would a family leave home and not only risk their own lives but also the lives of their children by doing such extraordinary things? What propels someone to walk without knowing where they will next break bread or quench their thirst?”",

Reuters photographer Adrees Latif stated the following about his photo: “In the river, dozens of migrant men had locked arms to make a snake-like human cordon from the Guatemalan side to Mexico, so no-one would get swept by its powerful pull. A family that had made it to the middle of the river was handing their children to other men to help them reach the shore. Moments later, the last set of migrants crossed, and the men who had locked hands in the cordon all swam towards Mexico and started celebrating that everyone in the caravan had made it safely. This photograph begs the question: why would a family leave home and not only risk their own lives but also the lives of their children by doing such extraordinary things? What propels someone to walk without knowing where they will next break bread or quench their thirst?”",

The Mapuches, first nation people hailing mostly from Chile and Argentina, are known for their struggles in defense of their rights, especially on land reform, and their flag has often been used as a symbol of protests against social inequality.",

The annual fire season in Australia began early and was exceptionally severe following months of record-breaking drought and fanned by strong winds. Far stronger wildfires than usual, mostly battled by volunteer firefighters, raged through Australia, laid waste to bushland and rainforest and destroyed homes. By the end of January 2020, more than 30 people had been killed, 3,000 homes lost and around 12.6 million hectares of land burned. Wildlife was harshly hit. Local scientists estimated that up to one billion animals perished, and more than 50% of the Gondwana rainforest traversing New South Wales and Queensland was burned. In December, while the intensity and speed at which many bushfires were spreading increased, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison went on holiday to Hawaii and was prompted to return only after the death of two volunteer firefighters. He continued to champion a pro-fossil fuel policy and held back from linking the fires to the climate crisis.",

					"extracto":"<b>Chapter 7: A Reality Television Star Won the Electoral College: How Mainstream News Media Played a Vital Role in the Electoral College Victory of the Made-for-TV Candidate, Donald Trump</b><br><br>In spite of Trump’s general election loss, the era of reality television show-like presidencies marches on. While the media in general is often rightly pointed to when it comes to explaining plenty having to do with and concerning the outgoing Trump administration and his head of state counterparts and allies, often forgotten from the picture is the vital role that the 1996 Telecommunications Act played in establishing the current media era of hyper-commercialism. In addition to exploring this overlooked history, consultation is undertaken of a number of scholarly accounts of the news media performance surrounding the election. This chapter’s main argument is that the ever-increasingly corporate conglomerate-owned news media itself was as leading of a factor as any other in Trump’s surprise 2016 Electoral College victory. The study concludes that long-observed and fundamental structural deficiencies of the U.S. and global news media, as opposed to a singular focus on the actions and decisions of mere individual journalists, serve as an overlooked yet equally vital culprit of such consequential media failings.<br><br>The chapter’s theoretical findings stand in contrast to more limited findings often reached by leading political communication scholars. Such distinctive findings between political communication and political economy have long existed, but there has been little dialogue or debate between the two subfields in spite of them being closely related to each other. This study is an attempt to spur on such debate and an argument for its need. It also serves as a call of sorts to other scholars of political economy, particularly to those who research journalism studies and news media performance, to also engage in this needed debate.",

It addresses the implications that the termination has already had on the delicate future of professional journalism, as well as its potential future impact and by extension, the consequences on democracy itself given the vital role of the Fourth Estate. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has still not restored Title II protections, a central component of net neutrality during the Obama administration, makes this study particularly timely.<br><br>The chapter first surveys and updates the ongoing and long-running crisis to professional journalism, which continues to suffer annual losses of professional news reporters and editors across the traditional media board, including important daily newspapers. A brief policy history of net neutrality protections is also undertaken including a close look at the widespread support for protections, which before the FCC reversal, were largely won via protracted and significant pressure from civil society. The study covers ways in which independent professional journalism can be unduly harmed without net neutrality protections, including the precedents and basis for such concerns given examples of other cases where net neutrality protections have been lacking or essentially non-existent.<br><br>The study concludes that net neutrality policies are intimately linked to the future of independent and professional journalism and that such a linkage should thus be accepted and further explored by scholarship while also being taken on by policy makers through the restoration of Title II net neutrality protections.",
